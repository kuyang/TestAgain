    <p>Hello Tim La La La</p>
    <p>What is for lunch</p>
    <p>Class is from Monday to Thursday</p>
    <h1>There is an Exam next week!</h1>
    <h2>Are you ready for an exam?</h2>
    <p>The resources that will help you prepare for the exam are the books, class lectures, and PowerPoints</p>
    <p>Yo
        His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
        There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
        He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
        To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
        What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
        He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
        He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now 
        The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
        Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
        Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
        He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No 
        He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes 
        It don't matter, 
        He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke 
        He's so stacked that he knows 
        When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
        Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody 
        He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him</p>
